    <h1 class="h2">About ArcadeHub</h1>
    <p>Welcome to ArcadeHub, your digital sanctuary for instant, free-to-play arcade games. We were founded on a simple belief: that the joy of gaming should be accessible to everyone, everywhere, without the barriers of cost, downloads, or intrusive data collection. Our platform is a tribute to the golden age of arcades, reimagined for the modern web.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>In today's world of complex installations, mandatory sign-ups, and invasive data tracking, we felt something was lost. We wanted to build a haven that brings gaming back to its roots: pure, unadulterated fun. Our mission is to provide a high-quality, carefully curated collection of classic and modern arcade games that load instantly in your browser. We handle the technical details so you can focus on what matters—beating that high score.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Zero Hassle:</strong> No downloads, no installations. Just click and play.</li>
          <li><strong>Completely Free:</strong> We are committed to keeping our games 100% free.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> We respect your privacy. Your high scores are stored on your device, and we collect no personal data.</li>

        <h2 class="h2">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p><strong>Curation over Quantity:</strong> We don't aim to have thousands of games. Instead, we hand-pick every title, ensuring it's lightweight, genuinely fun, and works seamlessly across all your devices. Each game is optimized for performance, providing a smooth, frustration-free experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Player-First Design:</strong> Your experience is our top priority. That means clean interfaces, no intrusive ads, and a focus on privacy. Whether you have five minutes to spare during a coffee break or an evening to relax, ArcadeHub is here to provide that perfect dose of nostalgia and entertainment. Thank you for being part of our community!</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Meet the Founder</h2>
      <p>ArcadeHub was started by Alex, a lifelong gamer and web developer who missed the simplicity of classic arcade halls. "I wanted to create the kind of place I'd want to hang out in," Alex says. "A straightforward, honest-to-goodness game site. No tricks, no hidden costs, just games. The fact that high scores are stored locally is a core part of that vision—it puts the player in complete control of their data."</p>
      <p>This project is a labor of love, built on a foundation of respect for the player and a passion for the timeless appeal of arcade gaming.</p>
