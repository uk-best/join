<h1 class="h2">Cookie Policy</h1>
<p class="small">Last updated: 2025-09-02</p>
<p>This Cookie Policy explains how ArcadeHub ("we", "us", and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
<h2 class="h3">What Are Cookies?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
<h2 class="h3">How We Use Cookies</h2>
<p>We use cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our platform. Specifically, we use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as the privacy consent banner. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the website to you, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our site functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance and Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information that is used in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are. This helps us to customize and improve our site for you. The data is anonymous and not tied to any individual.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h3">Local Storage</h2>
<p>In addition to cookies, we use your browser's <code>localStorage</code> functionality. This is a key part of our privacy-first approach. All your game high scores are stored directly on your device using <code>localStorage</code>. This data is never transmitted to our servers automatically. You have full and exclusive control over this data and can clear it at any time through your browser settings or via the "Clear Local Scores" button on our site.</p>
<h2 class="h3">Managing Cookies</h2>
<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by setting or amending your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website, though your access to some functionality and areas may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
